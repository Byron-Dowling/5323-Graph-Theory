Program 3
IMPORTANT REMINDERS: All programs must include your name and
description of program in comments and in output. All programs must include
comments to increase readability of your code. Do not use global variables (global
constants are acceptable). If functions are written, pass parameters if/when needed.
This is an individual or small group assignment (at most three people per group; four
people can split into two groups of two). General ideas may be discussed among
groups, but code cannot be shared from one group to another.
Write a program that will implement a shortest path algorithm. You may write your
own code, if you are industrious, or use a pre-built algorithm.
Use your program to run real data from any legitimate source. Data may be pulled
directly into the program or you may copy/paste into a file. The type of data is
entirely up to you; any data that can be mapped using a weighted graph is acceptable.
Large data sets may be time consuming. It is accep
