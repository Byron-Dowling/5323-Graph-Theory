    IMPORTANT REMINDERS: All programs must include your name and
    description of program in comments and in output. All programs must include
    comments to increase readability of your code. Do not use global variables (global
    constants are acceptable). If functions are written, pass parameters if/when needed.
    This is an individual assignment. General ideas may be discussed, but code cannot be
    shared.
    
    Write a program that will implement a Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm. You may
    write your own code, if you are industrious, or use a pre-built algorithm.
    Visually represent the MST using code from your previous project or another
    visualization tool. Show the initial graph and the MST in one picture. For example,
    draw the initial graph with the edges of the MST using dashed lines or a different
    color.
